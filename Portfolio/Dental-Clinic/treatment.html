          <h3>Teeth Cleaning & Scaling</h3>
          <p>
            At Sakthi Dental Clinic, we offer advanced, non-surgical gum care
            using modern LASER technology for precise and effective treatment.
            Whether you're dealing with early signs of gum disease or a more
            advanced condition, our skilled professionals ensure thorough
            cleaning to restore gum health. Scaling is advised for moderate
            cases to remove plaque and tartar buildup, while more severe
            periodontal issues may require deep cleaning procedures like root
            planing, supported by LASER treatment. This approach not only treats
            existing problems but also serves as a crucial preparatory step
            before any surgical intervention.

            prevent future issues. Our focus is on relieving pain, eliminating
            infection, and preserving your natural tooth structure for long-term

            repositioning it for optimal healing. This treatment helps prevent
            further periodontal issues and supports gum health.
